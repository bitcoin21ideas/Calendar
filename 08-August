8/4 2010 - "Bitcoin isn't currently practical for very small micropayments.  Not for things like pay per search or per page view without an aggregating mechanism, not things needing to pay less than 0.01.  The dust spam limit is a first try at intentionally trying to prevent overly small micropayments like that. Bitcoin is practical for smaller transactions than are practical with existing payment methods.  Small enough to include what you might call the top of the micropayment range.  But it doesn't claim to be practical for arbitrarily small micropayments."

8/5 2010 - "Forgot to add the good part about micropayments.  While I don't think Bitcoin is practical for smaller micropayments right now, it will eventually be as storage and bandwidth costs continue to fall.  If Bitcoin catches on on a big scale, it may already be the case by that time.  Another way they can become more practical is if I implement client-only mode and the number of network nodes consolidates into a smaller number of professional server farms.  Whatever size micropayments you need will eventually be practical.  I think in 5 or 10 years, the bandwidth and storage will seem trivial.""
    2011 - A week after being hacked, a MyBitcoin spokesperson explains how the Bitcoin transaction processor lost over 150,000 Bitcoins, worth over US$2 million at the time."

8/7 2010 - "It's the same situation as gold and gold mining.  The marginal cost of gold mining tends to stay near the price of gold.  Gold mining is a waste, but that waste is far less than the utility of having gold available as a medium of exchange. I think the case will be the same for Bitcoin. The utility of the exchanges made possible by Bitcoin will far exceed the cost of electricity used. Therefore, not having Bitcoin would be the net waste.""
    2010 - "Proof-of-work has the nice property that it can be relayed through untrusted middlemen.  We don't have to worry about a chain of custody of communication.  It doesn't matter who tells you a longest chain, the proof-of-work speaks for itself."""

8/9 2010 - "The heat from your computer is not wasted if you need to heat your home.  If you're using electric heat where you live, then your computer's heat isn't a waste.  It's equal cost if you generate the heat with your computer. If you have other cheaper heating than electric, then the waste is only the difference in cost. If it's summer and you're using A/C, then it's twice. \nBitcoin generation should end up where it's cheapest.  Maybe that will be in cold climates where there's electric heat, where it would be essentially free."

8/11 2010 - Then you must also be against the common system of payment up front, where the customer loses. Payment up front  customer loses, and the thief gets the money. Simple escrow  customer loses, but the thief doesn't get the money either. Are you guys saying payment up front is better, because at least the thief gets the money, so at least someone gets it? Imagine someone stole something from you.  You can't get it back, but if you could, if it had a kill switch that could be remote triggered, would you do it?  Would it be a good thing for thieves to know that everything you own has a kill switch and if they steal it, it'll be useless to them, although you still lose it too?  If they give it back, you can re-activate it. Imagine if gold turned to lead when stolen.  If the thief gives it back, it turns to gold again. It still seems to me the problem may be one of presenting it the right way.  For one thing, not being so blunt about "money burning" for the purposes of game theory discussion.  The money is never truly burned.  You have the option to release it at any time forever."

     2010 - Only major vulnerability (inflation bug) fixed - bug in the bitcoin code allows a bad transaction into block 74638. Users quickly adopt fixed code and the ""good"" block chain overtook the bad one at a block height of 74691, 53 blocks later
     2010 - "Some places where generation will gravitate to: 1) places where it's cheapest or free 2) people who want to help for idealogical reasons 3) people who want to get some coins without the inconvenience of doing a transaction to buy them. There are legitimate places where it's free.  Generation is basically free anywhere that has electric heat, since your computer's heat is offsetting your baseboard electric heating.  Many small flats have electric heat out of convenience."

8/16 1992 - A proof-of-work system for email spam is presented at the 12th Annual International Cryptology Conference (CRYPTO'92) at the campus of University of California. The main idea is to require a user to compute a moderately hard, but not intractable, function in order to gain access to the resource, thus preventing frivolous use.
     2010 - "There is no way for the software to automatically know if one chain is better than another except by the greatest proof-of-work.  In the design it was necessary for it to switch to a longer chain no matter how far back it has to go.""

8/27 2010 - "As a thought experiment, imagine there was a base metal as scarce as gold but with the following properties: boring grey in colour - not a good conductor of electricity - not particularly strong, but not ductile or easily malleable either - not useful for any practical or ornamental purpose and one special, magical property:  can be transported over a communications channel. If it somehow acquired any value at all for whatever reason, then anyone wanting to transfer wealth over a long distance could buy some, transmit it, and have the recipient sell it. Maybe it could get an initial value circularly as you've suggested, by people foreseeing its potential usefulness for exchange.  (I would definitely want some)  Maybe collectors, any random reason could spark it. I think the traditional qualifications for money were written with the assumption that there are so many competing objects in the world that are scarce, an object with the automatic bootstrap of intrinsic value will surely win out over those without intrinsic value.  But if there were nothing in the world with intrinsic value that could be used as money, only scarce but no intrinsic value, I think people would still take up something. (I'm using the word scarce here to only mean limited potential supply)"
     2010 - "Bitcoins have no dividend or potential future dividend, therefore not like a stock. More like a collectible or commodity."
