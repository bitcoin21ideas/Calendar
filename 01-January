    2009 - "If you can keep a node running that accepts incoming connections, you'll really be helping the network a lot. Port 8333 on your firewall needs to be open to receive incoming connections.""
    2009 - "You can get coins by getting someone to send you some, or turn on Options->Generate Coins to run a node and generate blocks. I made the proof-of-work difficulty ridiculously easy to start with, so for a little while in the beginning a typical PC will be able to generate coins in just a few hours. It'll get a lot harder when competition makes the automatic adjustment drive up the difficulty. Generated coins must wait 120 blocks to mature before they can be spent.""
    2009 - "There are two ways to send money. If the recipient is online, you can enter their IP address and it will connect, get a new public key and send the transaction with comments. If the recipient is not online, it is possible to send to their Bitcoin address, which is a hash of their public key that they give you. They'll receive the transaction the next time they connect and get the block it's in. This method has the disadvantage that no comment information is sent, and a bit of privacy may be lost if the address is used multiple times, but it is a useful alternative if both users can't be online at the same time or the recipient can't receive incoming connections.""
    2009 - "Total circulation will be 21,000,000 coins. It'll be distributed to network nodes when they make blocks, with the amount cut in half every 4 years. first 4 years 10,500,000 coins, next 4 years 5,250,000 coins, next 4 years  2,625,000 coins, next 4 years  1,312,500 coins, etc...When that runs out, the system can support transaction fees if needed. It's based on open market competition, and there will probably always be nodes willing to process transactions for free.""
    2009 - Bitcoin v0.1 released and announced on the cryptography mailing list - Compiled with Microsoft Visual Studio for Windows, it lacks a command line interface and is so complete that it furthers speculation that it was developed by more than one person (or by an academic with little programming experience and a great deal of theoretical know-how)"

1/21 2016 - Launch of Segregated Witness Testnet. This development began with a research effort by Bitcoin Core developer, Dr. Pieter Wuille, initially focused on addressing transaction malleability, a longstanding and well-known concern and priority. However, in the process of this research, and in the narrowing toward a solution, additional properties of the solution were discovered that allow for increasing the block size while also simultaneously opening up some incredibly exciting secondary benefits. This effort was initiated by Dr. Pieter Wuille, but included contributions from many others, with particular thanks to Eric Lombrozo, Johnson Lau, Alex Morcos, Nicolas Dorier, Bryan Bishop, Gregory Maxwell, Peter Todd, Cory Fields, Suhas Daftuar, and Luke-Jr. Popular wallets and supporting libraries have stated they will support Segwit including Ledger, Trezor, Electrum, and Bitgo.
