## Contribution guidelines

You want to help, but don't know how to do it or which tool to use?
Let's take step by step.


1. **Fork the repo**

    This is the first and necessary step.
You will know have full control over the files displayed.
Do your modifications in your forked repo.

2. **Analyze what is important**

   There is a lot to be done, the quotes range are more than a decade.
The calendar is updated yearly, with each special phrase being uniquely chosen to match a given day.
With all this work, set focus on a important task, this will give the best performance overall then trying to correct dense files.

3. **Pull request**

   When you concluded all the changes, open a pull request, very welcome.
Opening a pull request does not mean it will be accepted, but surely will be thoroughly.
If me (the owner) of this repo sees value present on the modifications proposed, your request will be merged. If it is not entirely merge, don't worry, taste is not the same for everyone.
