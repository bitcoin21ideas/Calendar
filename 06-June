If SHA-256 became completely broken, I think we could come to some agreement about what the honest block chain was before the trouble started, lock that in and continue from there with a new hash function."

6/17 2010 - "The nature of Bitcoin is such that once version 0.1 was released, the core design was set in stone for the rest of its lifetime.  Because of that, I wanted to design it to support every possible transaction type I could think of.  The problem was, each thing required special support code and data fields whether it was used or not, and only covered one special case at a time.  It would have been an explosion of special cases.  The solution was script, which generalizes the problem so transacting parties can describe their transaction as a predicate that the node network evaluates.  The nodes only need to understand the transaction to the extent of evaluating whether the sender's conditions are met."
     2010 - "The design supports a tremendous variety of possible transaction types that I designed years ago.  Escrow transactions, bonded contracts, third party arbitration, multi-party signature, etc.  If Bitcoin catches on in a big way, these are things we'll want to explore in the future, but they all had to be designed at the beginning to make sure they would be possible later."
6/18 2010 - "Excellent choice of a first project, nice work.  I had planned to do this exact thing if someone else didn't do it, so when it gets too hard for mortals to generate 50BTC, new users could get some coins to play with right away.  Donations should be able to keep it filled.  The display showing the balance in the dispenser encourages people to top it up. You should put a donation bitcoin address on the page for those who want to add funds to it, which ideally should update to a new address whenever it receives something."
     2010 - "Since 2007.  At some point I became convinced there was a way to do this without any trust required at all and couldn't resist to keep thinking about it.  Much more of the work was designing than coding. Fortunately, so far all the issues raised have been things I previously considered and planned for."

6/19 2011 - MtGox suffers a significant breach of security that results in fraudulent trading and requires the site to be shut down for seven days. The breach compromises the MtGox database with a leak of the user table that contains user names, email addresses, and password hashes of 60,000 accounts. An admin account was accessed from which sell orders were issued for hundreds of thousands of Bitcoins, which forced the MtGox price down to US$17.51 to US$0.01 per Bitcoin. 
     2011 - In order to prove that MtGox still had control of the coins, the move of 424,242 bitcoins from ""cold storage"" to a MtGox address was announced beforehand and executed in Block 132749. It was later revealed that the coins may have never been in cold storage, as the proof-of-solvency transaction was broadcast through a remote Linux desktop and a single hot wallet. 
     2011 - Trading halts at TradeHill and Britcoin while security measures are reviewed. Users that were registered at MyBitcoin with the same username as on MtGox had their passwords hacked and balances stolen from around 600 MyBitcoin accounts, with one user losing more than 2,000 BTC."

     2016 - CSV softfork - Important upgrade instructions for miners TL;DR

Check all your nodes have been upgraded to Bitcoin Core 0.12.1 or compatible software. This must happen before block #419328. Note that if your GBT client(s) implement the protocol correctly, you will need to patch in PR #8176 (patch) or use Bitcoin Knots which already includes it.

If you hardcode the block version please unset bit 0 of the version field before block 419328, or preferably stop hardcoding it and let bitcoind do it automatically.

Use a nLockTime value of 0xffffffff for the generation transaction to avoid any potential conflict with BIP113.

If you have to use a different nLockTime value, you must follow the instructions carefully."
